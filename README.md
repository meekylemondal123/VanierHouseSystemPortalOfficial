# Welcome to Vanier's House System Portal! 

Welcome to **Vanier's Official House System Portal**. This is a system made for students in order to aid them integrating into the house system at Vanier (assuming it is on going, of course!). In this readme, you can find the information for nearly everything that you will need from here on out, that being making any changes, fixing any bugs or introducing an entirely new aspect! So let's get right into it.


# Basic Information
This system was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript, pretty basic, I know, but if it works, it works. The respective files where you can this information is **index.html, HouseSystemFrontEnd.css, and filereading.js**. Regarding why it's called index.html, this website is/was (depending on where we decide on hosting it) hosted on *github pages*, and in order for the webpage to display the information in the HTML file, you must name it index.html. Their rules, not mine. If you need to make any changes, be it adding a new element, changing the colour scheme or adding some more functionality to the website, you can make changes to the respective file
