                <p>Vangard was an ancient viking civilization that was divided into 4 house teams: Valour, 
                Harmony, Justice and Wisdom. Each house had their own crest, and they were always competing against eachother
                in order to get their hands on the prestigious Vanier Cup. Their time was over long ago, but now it is your turn
                to continue the tradition! The students have been divided into one of the four house teams from Vangard, and your 
                job is to gather points, through participating in school events, in order to bring your houseteam to glory! 
                <br><br>
